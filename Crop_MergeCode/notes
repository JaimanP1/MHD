Want to try to make a cropped region so that field lines and vector field is confined to poles

constants: name of variables
common: 
subroutines:
main

What variable should I look for
Which file should I change


------------
in constants.f90:


N(X/Y)_ARR was changed from 360 to 260
n(x/y)_avs was changed from 0 to 100


Used these numbers because this is what I use for rake region for field lines in VAPOR

want to only focus on constants because this way I do not interupt the actual code itself, only the parameters
