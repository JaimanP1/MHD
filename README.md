# MHD
MHD code from work with Prof Satoshi Inoue, CSTR, NJIT

This code outputs both binary and vdc data to generate Magnetic Flux ropes in quadrupolar photosphere topologies for Coronal Mass Ejections. The vdc data can be visualized in VAPOR. 

This code is parallelized.

Refer to Wiki page for more information (in progress)

Currently working on implementing a RAM function in order to stop twisting motion at an earlier time.
