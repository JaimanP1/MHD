A project to interact with VAPOR API.

Only run these scripts in the project directory, not your home directory. 

The instructions file sets up a conda environment and installs the appropriate packages using mamba. 
Copy the commands and run as needed.
The install process will take at least 45 minutes, as the vapor module is approximately 2 GB.

The .bov file is a header file for a Brick of Values unformatted data output by Fortran.
It allows the API to read the raw binary data.
Replace paths as appropriate.

The python script saves a render using the API to a .png file. 
Use ffmpeg to stitch together .png to a .mp4

Currently, following the instructions in the environment setup file and run attempt9 is working pipeline for field lines confined to a cross section.
The attempt10 script is for fully 3d field lines, though there are some issues with getting the field lines to render properly, namely with the integration steps parameter.

Feel free to ask me questions as needed and contribute to the code.
