A project to interact with VAPOR API.

ONLY RUN THESE SCRIPTS IN THE PROJECT DIRECTORY 

The environment file sets up a conda environment and installs the appropriate packages using mamba. 
It is incomplete, so do not run it. 
Instead, copy the commands and run as needed.
The install process will take roughly 45 minutes, as the vapor module is approximately 13G

The .bov file is a header file for a Brick of Values unformatted data output by Fortran.
It allows the API to read the raw binary data.
Replace paths as appropriate.

The python script saves a render using the API to a .png file. 
Currently, only a 3D grid can viewed.

All scripts here are very rudimentary tests. 
A more programmatic workflow will be developed when the API is proven to be successful in rendering a complete eruption.
The goal is to have one bash script to run which automatically sets up the environment, writes the format for the files, and calls the API.
The user can then interactively adjust parameters as needed. 

High hopes...
